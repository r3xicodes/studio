/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for PlanItRight Firestore Database
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for classes and assignments.
 * Each user has full control over their own data, and no cross-user access is permitted.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All data is nested under /users/{userId}.
 * Classes are stored in /users/{userId}/classes/{classId}.
 * Assignments are stored in /users/{userId}/classes/{classId}/assignments/{assignmentId}.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access data under their own user ID.
 * - No data is publicly accessible.
 * - Listing other user's classes or assignments is disallowed.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The data structure is denormalized by design:
 * - The user ID is implicitly part of the path for both classes and assignments, eliminating the need for `get()` calls to verify ownership.
